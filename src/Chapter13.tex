\begin{problem}{13.1}
  Your research has identified a monthly signal with IR=1. You notice that delaying its implementation by one quarter reduces the IR to 0.75. What is the signal's half-life? What is the half-life of the value added?

\begin{problem}{13.3}
  You forecast $\alpha=2$ percent for a stock with $\omega=25$ percent, based on a signal with $\mathrm{IC}=0.05$. Suddenly the stock moves, with $\theta=10$ percent. How should you adjust your alpha? Is it now positive or negative?
